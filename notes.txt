    • Endpoint 13 - GET /promotion/
    • Endpoint 15 - DELETE /promotion/:id
    • Endpoint 16 - GET /promotion/flight/:flightid

    • Endpoint 19 - GET /review/:flightid

    * Addtional Quality of Life APIs

# 11 APIs

? Endpoint 11: How do you select which transfer flight to take if there are mutliple flights of the same route?
? E.g. There are 2 flights going from Airport 1 to Airport 2, which one of those flight do I select?
.. Distance function? Cost? Airline?
.. Could use a transfer table
    ! Still would need to select a flight.

# 2 Bonus APIs

* 1st Bonus
• Create endpoint for image uploading/storage and retrieval of product listing from the server. 
• Server should only accept jpg or png images below 1 MB.
! Need to find sources for this method, or referencing it from Hong Yu's work
? Seems likely to be a POST request


* 2nd Bonus
• Create endpoints related to the offering of discounts for promotional periods.
• Your endpoints should include GET, POST, and DELETE. 
• GET endpoints should provide info of promotion period and discount offered for particular flights. 
• Note that the appropriate table(s) should be created in the database and 
• that a flight can have multiple promotional periods.
? This endpoint requires GET, POST and DELETE

# Extra Possible Features?
.. Async programming
.. Uploading & Storage of images
    • Use express-file-upload.
.. Adding a Distance function
    • This can be used to select the transfer flight with the shortest Distance
    • Could also factor in if a transfer flight has an offer
.. Add a price and embarkDate filter function
